Non-Invasive Blood Glucometer using Near Infrared Spectroscopy


**AIM**

We introduce a non-invasive method for measuring blood sugar levels using Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy. By analyzing the amount of NIR light passing through the ear lobe, the device detects glucose molecules in the blood. This approach eliminates the need for painful finger pricks, offering a more convenient option for individuals with diabetes. However, further research and clinical validation are necessary to ensure accuracy and reliability before widespread adoption.


**SCOPE**

Better patient experience as the device is non invasive 
Reduces the risk of infection as no needles are involved
Continuous monitoring to ensure that the patient is always up to date
